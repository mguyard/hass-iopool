## Collect Issues information

### Diagnostic File

On the device info page for the device entity, you will see a "Download Diagnostics" button.
Make sure you upload this to your GitHub issue.

<Warning>
All confidential information is REDACTED, but please verify before uploading the file to your GitHub issue.
</Warning>

### Debug Logging

When logging a bug, always ensure you send us the debug logs. 

If you are hitting issues during initial integration setup, you will need to enable logs in your `configuration.yaml` file by adding the following and restarting Home Assistant:
```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.iopool: debug // [!code highlight]
```

If you have previously successfully installed the integration, debug logs can be enabled from the integration page within Home Assistant:

When you disable debug logs through the interface, the integration logs will be automatically downloaded.
Also, the debug logs will appear in the standard Home Assistant logs.

## Declare issue

If you encounter an issue, you can [open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/mguyard/hass-iopool/issues/new/choose) and share all relevant information to help us resolve it as quickly as possible.

<Warning>
Logs may contain confidential or personal information (API key, pool names, etc...). Therefore, it is essential that you verify the content of all logs/files that you share.
