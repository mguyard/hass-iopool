# Introduction

The iopool integration for Home Assistant allows you to seamlessly connect and monitor your iopool EcO pool system within the Home Assistant platform.
This integration provides real-time monitoring of your pool parameters, enabling you to track temperature, pH, ORP (oxidation-reduction potential), and other important data directly from Home Assistant.
