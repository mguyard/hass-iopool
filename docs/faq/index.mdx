</Accordion>

## Features

### What entities are created by the integration?

<Accordion title="See the list" icon="table-list">
See the [Entities documentation](/integration/entities) for a full list of sensors, binary sensors, and selectors created for each pool.
</Accordion>

### How do I enable entity name and option translations?

<Accordion title="Entity name translations" icon="language">
To have entity names and options translated, you must set the server language in your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
homeassistant:
  language: fr
```

Changing only your user profile language is **not** sufficient for entity names and options.  
For all other texts (UI, menus, etc.), the translation is based on your user profile language.
</Accordion>

### How does Boost mode work?

<Accordion title="How to use Boost" icon="bolt">
Boost mode allows you to temporarily increase filtration for 1h, 4h, 8h, or 24h.  
You can activate Boost via the `Boost Selector` entity in Home Assistant or through automations.
</Accordion>

### Can I use the integration with multiple pools?

<Accordion title="Multi-pool support" icon="layer-group">
Yes, the integration supports multiple pools. Each pool is configured as a separate device in Home Assistant.
</Accordion>

## Errors

### "No pools found. Please check your iopool sensor is under this API key."

<Accordion title="What does this mean?" icon="circle-question">
This means the API Key you provided does not have any pools associated with it.  
Check that your EcO device is registered in your iopool account and that you copied the correct API Key from the iopool app.
</Accordion>

### "Switch entity is required when filtration (summer or winter) is enabled."

<Accordion title="How to solve?" icon="toggle-on">
You must select a Home Assistant switch entity that controls your pool pump in the integration options.  
Without this, filtration automation cannot be enabled.
</Accordion>

### "Minimum duration cannot be greater than maximum duration."

<Accordion title="How to solve?" icon="arrow-down-1-9">
Check your filtration options and ensure the minimum duration is less than or equal to the maximum duration.
</Accordion>

## Events

### What events does the integration publish?

<Accordion title="See event details" icon="bell">
The integration publishes events such as boost start/end, slot start/end, and winter filtration events.  
See the [Events documentation](/integration/events) for details and examples.
</Accordion>
